Release Info
-------------

Compatible with eZ Publish 4.1 and newer.


Install
-------

- Put the mbpaex folder inside your extension folder

- Update the eZ Publish database, from the root of the site:

    $ mysql -u <username> -p<password> <ezdatabase> < extension/mbpaex/mysql/mbpaex.sql

  If you're using PostgreSQL use the extension/mbpaex/sql/postgresql/mbpaex.sql file instead.

- Customize the default settings in 
  extension/mbpaex/settings/mbpaex.ini (or an override):

    [mbpaexSettings]
    # Regular expression used for password validation when 
    # none is defined in the contentobject
    PasswordValidationRegexp=
    
    # Default lifetime for password in DAYS
    # 0 means no limit (passwords never expire)
    DefaultPasswordLifeTime=0
    
    # Number of seconds before password expiration to send a
    # mail notification to the user
    # Default 172800 (2 days)
    ExpirationNotification=172800
    
    # Number of seconds that the forgot password generated hash will be valid
    # Default 86400 (1 day)
    ForgotPasswordHashLifeTime=86400

    # Login of the eZ user used in the updatechildren cronjob, must have access to 
    # read the Users section.
    UpdateChildrenUser=admin

- Activate the extension in your site.ini
    
    ActiveExtensions[]=mbpaex
    
- Setup the override template used in replacement of node/view/full.tpl to display
  users and users groups in admin interface:
  
  Inside the <ezroot>/extension/mbpaex/settings/siteaccess you will find a folder
  that will be used in the "admin" siteaccess. If your admin siteaccess has a 
  different name, the content of the override.ini.append.php file must be added 
  to the override.ini of your custom admin siteaccess.
  
- Re-generate the autoloads array to include new classes present in the extension:

    $ bin/php/ezpgenerateautoloads.php --extension
    
- Clear all caches


Brief usage instructions
------------------------

After installation, a new data type would be available to add as an attribute in 
the User and User Group classes, "Password Expiration". You should add a new 
attribute to your classes using this new data type for the system to behave correctly.

When the attribute gets created it takes the values set in the ini file as default
values.

To prevent that all existing users are forced to change their passwords, there is
a script available to reset the password_last_updated value of all users to current
time. You can run this script with the following command:
    
    $ php extension/mbpaex/install/scripts/setpasswordlastupdated.php

When you customize the values in a user group, a checkbox would appear to update
children nodes with the values of the current group, this way you can customize
the password lifetime and validation regexp per group easily. (See point 4)

There is a new function to restrict if a user can edit the paex data, editpaex.
If anyone other than admin should be able to update the paex data, a new policy 
with this function should be added to his role.

When someone changes the password for another user, the password last update time 
is set to 0 to force the user change his password the next time he tries to log in. 

    NOTE: There must be a password lifetime defined in order to force the user
    change his password. If PasswordLifeTime is set to 0 the user never gets 
    forced to change its password (the password never expires).

When the password for a user is expired, the user never gets logged in, he only 
can access the change password view from userpaex module to change his password.

When a user changes their password, the system prevents to enter the same 
password currently set, this way a new different one must be used.

When a user or group is published the first time, if the current user don't have
"editpaex" permission set in their roles, the system automatically obtains the 
actual paex data set in parent.
If the user have "editpaex" permission, the values entered in the form will be used,
to use values set in parent, these fields must be cleared.


Forgot password procedure
--------------------------

There is a new view in the userpaex module, forgotpassword, to manage the forgot
password function. 

Has small modifications from the eZ one, to note:

- The user is required to enter his email address
- A new hash key is generated, and the user receives an email with a link pointing 
  to a form to choose a new password. Also in this email, there is an expiration 
  datetime to inform the user that this link should be removed.
- When the user clicks the link and sets a new password, the hash key is removed
  from the forgot password table.
- The time the hash key remains valid is defined in the ini value 
  ForgotPasswordHashLifeTime in seconds, with a default value of 86400 (24 hours)
- If a second hash key is requested without having used the previous one, they 
  will be removed, so only the last key generated is valid.


UpdateChildren feature
-----------------------

In order to prevent failures during the process and to make the user edit process 
quicker, the update children has moved to a cronjob, so a new cronjob task has to
be set for the update be actually done.
The cronjob part defined to do the actual update of the children is "updatechildren"

The cronjob can be manually run with the following command from <ezroot> folder:

    $ php runcronjobs.php updatechildren

When a node is marked to update his children, a notification text will be shown 
in the admin view template for that node.

Only group nodes have the updatechildren checkbox displayed in the edit template.

The updates are applied from outer to inner nodes, so, if you have a node set to 
update his chidren, and then one of the children nodes also set to update his ones,
that children node will not be updated with the data from parent, instead, their 
children will be updated with his data.

It's ok to set up the cronjob to be run in the frequent cronjob part.


"Password about to Expire" notification
---------------------------------------

Optionally if you want your users get notified when their password is about to 
expire, a new cronjob can be set up to search users based on their password last 
updated time and password lifetime, and if it results in a password remain time 
less that configured expiration notification time, a mail will be generated and 
sent to the users so they can change their password prior to expiration.

The cronjob can be manually run with the following command from <ezroot> folder:

    $ php runcronjobs.php send_expiry_notifications

Only one notification sent to each user, and no more notifications are sent until
the user changes his password and it expires again.


Audit logs
----------

In order to enhance security new audit functions have been defined for mbpaex operations
that can be enabled in an override for the audit.ini settings file:

- user-password-change

    Logs pasword changes made to third party accounts (admin changing password for a
    user)

- user-password-change-self

    Logs when users change their own password

- user-password-change-self-fail

    Logs when users try to change their own password and send wrong current password

- user-forgotpassword

    User has made use of the forgotpassword function of userpaex module

- user-forgotpassword-fail

    User tries to made use of the forgotpassword function of userpaex module but
    some error occurred (the actual error is also logged)


TODO list
---------

- Prevent user enter same password that have set, when editing user contentobject
  from admin interface (I think that password history has to be implemented to do 
  this).


About mbpaex
------------

This extension was developed by Microblau with eZ Systems support.


Known issues
------------

This extension will not work on the admin siteaccess, or any siteaccess that has
the following ini configuration:

    [SiteAccessSettings]
    RequireUserLogin=true
    
It doesn't work because if the password has expired the user will be taked to the
'/userpaex/password/' view which the user can't access without logging in first 
when RequireUserLogin=true.
